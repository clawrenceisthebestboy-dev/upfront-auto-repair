Hi [Customer Name], thank you for your honest feedback — we really do appreciate it.

We're glad [mention any positive aspect if noted in review], but it sounds like we fell short of the experience we want every customer to have. That's not okay with us, and we want to make it right.

Would you be open to giving us a call at **(207) 648-4747)**? We'd love to hear more about what happened and see what we can do. Our goal is for every customer to leave feeling confident they were treated fairly — and it sounds like we missed the mark here.

Hi [Customer Name], thank you for sharing your experience — and we're truly sorry it wasn't what it should have been.

We take feedback like this seriously. Our whole business is built on being honest and transparent with customers, and if you felt that didn't happen during your visit, we want to understand why and make it right.

Please call us directly at **(207) 648-4747** and ask to speak with [Owner/Manager name]. We're not going to make excuses — we'd rather listen, learn, and do what it takes to fix this.

## Template 5 — 1-Star Angry Review Response (De-escalation)

**Use when:** Customer is very upset, possibly using strong language, may or may not have a factual basis for the complaint

---

Hi [Customer Name], we're sorry to see this, and we're sorry you had this experience.

We understand you're frustrated, and we're not going to dismiss that. Whatever happened — or whatever was communicated — clearly didn't meet your expectations, and that matters to us.

We'd sincerely like the opportunity to talk with you directly. Would you be willing to call us at **(207) 648-4747)** and speak with [Owner Name]? We want to hear your side fully, and if we made a mistake, we want to own it and make it right.

We know a one-star review on a small local business is significant, and we don't take it lightly. Our reputation in Standish is built on trust — we'd like to have the chance to try to restore yours.

Thank you for letting us know.

## General Response Tips

- **Never argue publicly** — if facts are disputed, invite them to call
- **Respond to every review** — even 5-stars; it shows you're engaged
- **Personalize** — reference what they had done if mentioned
- **Don't copy-paste robotically** — vary the openers slightly
- **Keep it short** — 3-5 sentences is usually enough; long responses can seem defensive
- **Report fake reviews** — if a 1-star review appears to be from someone you've never seen, flag it for removal through Google/Yelp's process
