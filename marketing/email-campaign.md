## Email 2 — Re-Engagement Email ("We Miss You" — 6+ months no visit)

**Subject Line:** It's been a while, [First Name] — everything okay with your car?

**Preview Text:** We miss you (and more importantly, we want to make sure your car is in good shape).

Hi [First Name],

It's been about six months since we last saw you at Up Front Auto Repair, and we just wanted to check in.

We know life gets busy — and sometimes car maintenance gets pushed to the back burner. But with Maine winters (and those spring potholes that follow), it's worth keeping up with.

**Here's a quick checklist:**

🔋 **Battery** — Most batteries last 3–5 years. Cold weather shortens that.
🛢️ **Oil** — When was your last change? If it's been 5,000+ miles, it's time.
🛑 **Brakes** — If you hear anything unusual, or if it's been over a year, worth a quick check.
🔄 **Tires** — Rotation every 5,000–7,500 miles extends tire life significantly.

We'd love to see you back. To make it easier, we're offering **$10 off any service over $75** for returning customers this month. Just mention this email when you call or come in.

No pressure — just a genuine offer from your neighbors on Ossipee Trail.

Hope to see you soon.

Warmly,
The Team at Up Front Auto Repair

## Email 3 — Seasonal Special Offer (Spring Checkup)

**Subject Line:** Spring in Maine = Pothole Season 🌱 Is Your Car Ready?

**Preview Text:** Free spring inspection + a special offer just for you.

---

Hi [First Name],

Spring has finally arrived in Maine — and if your car survived another Standish winter, it deserves a little attention.

Between the road salt, the freeze-thaw cycles, and those legendary Maine potholes, this time of year is actually the best time to give your vehicle a thorough check.

**This month only, we're offering:**

🌱 **Free Spring Road Ready Inspection** with any service (a $49.99 value) — includes:
- Full undercarriage inspection for rust/salt corrosion
- Alignment check
- Fluid levels topped off
- Tire wear and pressure assessment
- Brake visual inspection

Plus, mention this email and get **$15 off any repair over $100.**

Maine roads in April can be rough. The last thing you want is an alignment problem going unnoticed or a suspension component giving out because of winter damage.

**Book your appointment:**

Here's to a great spring in Maine! 🌲
