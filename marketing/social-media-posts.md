**Facebook Post 1 — Community Introduction / Brand Story**

Hey Standish! 👋 We want to take a second to remind you what Up Front Auto Repair is all about.

We opened our doors on Ossipee Trail because we were tired of the way a lot of auto shops do business — upselling people who don't need it, hiding fees in the fine print, and making customers feel like they don't have a choice.

"Up Front" isn't just a name. It's a promise. Before we touch your car, you get a written estimate. We explain what's wrong in plain English. If something can wait, we'll tell you it can wait. If something is urgent, we'll tell you *why* it's urgent.

We're your neighbors. We live here, our kids go to school here, we shop at the same stores you do. We plan on being part of this community for a long time — and that means earning your trust every single visit.

**Facebook Post 2 — Winter Car Care Tips**

❄️ Maine winter is no joke, and it is BRUTAL on your vehicle. Before the next big snowstorm hits Standish, here are a few things to check:

✅ **Battery** — Cold kills weak batteries fast. If yours is more than 3 years old, get it tested.
✅ **Antifreeze** — Make sure your coolant mix is rated for -30°F or below.
✅ **Tires** — Are your treads deep enough to grip icy roads? The penny test: insert a penny into the tread. If you can see all of Lincoln's head, it's time for new tires.
✅ **Windshield wipers** — Maine winter wipers are worth the upgrade. Trust us.
✅ **Oil** — If you're running conventional oil, ask us about switching to synthetic for better cold-weather performance.

Come see us before you need us! Free winter readiness check with any service this month.

**Facebook Post 3 — Customer Story (Testimonial Style)**

We love when this happens. 💙

A customer came to us last month after being quoted nearly $900 at another shop for a brake job. Full rotors, pads, the works — "all four corners need to be done immediately," they were told.

We took a look. Front pads were getting low, yes. But the rear brakes? Plenty of life left. Total for what actually *needed* doing: $210.

We're not going to pretend this makes us money. It doesn't. But it's the right thing to do. And that customer is now a customer for life.

If you've been quoted something that feels off, bring it to us for a second opinion. No charge for the inspection. We'll tell you exactly what we see.
